-- ABCD aggregation at the report level

-- Definitions (per drug/PT pair):
--   A: suspect drug present AND PT present in the same report
--   B: suspect drug present AND PT absent
--   C: suspect drug absent  AND PT present
--   D: neither (complement)

-- Notes:
-- - Default uses suspect-only (role = 1). CLI/UI can switch to role in (1,2,3)
--   by replacing the WHERE clause in the first CTE.
